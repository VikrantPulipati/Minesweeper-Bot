# Minesweeper-Bot

A convolutional neural network architecture that can learn to play an arbitrarily sized minesweeper board.

This project was completed as the final project for Introduction to Deep Learning at Rutgers University - New Brunswick.

The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the model as well as scripts to generate training data. Also included are pre-trained models that are tailored for various use cases.
